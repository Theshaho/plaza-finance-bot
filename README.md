# Auto Daily Plaza Finance Bot

This script automates interactions with Plaza Finance's faucet, ensuring unlimited spending for the wstETH token, creating Bond and Leverage tokens, and redeeming a portion of those tokens. It processes multiple wallets in a cycle, with a delay of 6 hours after all wallets are processed.

## Features
- Claims faucet tokens using cookies for multiple wallets.
- Sets unlimited allowance for wstETH token.
- Creates Bond and Leverage tokens.
- Redeems 50% of Bond and Leverage tokens' balance.
- Repeats the entire cycle every 6 hours.

## Requirements
- Node.js
- `web3`, `axios`, `chalk`, `fs`

Install the required Node.js modules:

```bash
npm install web3 axios chalk fs
```

## Setup

1. Add your private keys to the `private_keys.txt` file, with one private key per line. Ensure each key is exactly 64 characters (without 0x).
2. Add your cookies to the `cookies.txt` file, each on a new line. Ensure that each cookie corresponds to a wallet address in the `private_keys.txt` file.

### Files:
- `private_keys.txt`: Contains the private keys of your wallets.
- `cookies.txt`: Contains the cookies required to interact with the Plaza Finance faucet.

### Script Structure:

1. **Claim Faucet**: Claims tokens from Plaza Finance using the matched cookie for each wallet.
2. **Unlimited Spending for wstETH**: Ensures unlimited allowance for the wstETH token.
3. **Create Bond and Leverage Tokens**: Creates Bond and Leverage tokens with random deposit amounts.
4. **Redeem Tokens**: Redeems 50% of the balance of Bond and Leverage tokens.
5. **Delay and Retry**: Retries failed transactions with a 30-second delay and moves to the next wallet.
6. **Repeat**: The entire cycle repeats every 6 hours after processing all wallets.

## Usage

Run the script with Node.js:

```bash
node index.js
```

The script will run once immediately and will repeat every 6 hours.

## Logs

The script logs detailed information using `chalk` for colorful output, including:
- Faucet claim status
- Token allowance status
- Bond and Leverage token creation
- Token redemption

All successful transactions and errors are printed in the console with the appropriate formatting.

## Notes

- Ensure your private keys are correct, as invalid keys will result in errors.
- The cookies must match the correct wallet addresses, or the faucet claim will be skipped for that wallet.
